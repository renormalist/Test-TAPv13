        - DEPRECATED and DYSFUNCTIONAL for Test::More versions >= 1.302013_002 (Dec 2015)
          The module relied on internals of Test::Builder which are no
          longer available after Test::More was migrated to use Test2::Builder.
          If anyone depends on this module (which I doubt) I am happy to
          accept fixes or even hand over (co-)maintainership.
